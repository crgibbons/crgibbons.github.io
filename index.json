From stumping for Dukakis-Bentsen \u0026lsquo;88 as a first-grader and mailing her first one-pager to the White House when President George H.W. Bush came out as anti-broccoli in the early \u0026rsquo;90s, she has never been afraid to speak up on something that matters to her. Though her early efforts to effect political (and vegetable) change were not successful, she\u0026rsquo;s gotten better with practice.\nCourtney Gibbons is a mathematician and policy worker with experience in the legislative and executive branches of the Federal government. Currently an associate professor of mathematics, she joined the faculty at Hamilton College in July, 2013.\nIn the 2023-2024 academic year, Dr. Gibbons is a fellow hosted at the National Science Foundation in the Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering Directorate, Intelligent Systems Division, as an AI policy fellow through the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow program. In the 2022-2023 academic year, she was a legislative branch fellow working for the majority staff of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee of the U.S. Senate (Chairman Gary C. Peters)  covering parts of the portfolio related to Federal data, artificial intelligence, and financial assistance.\nIn her life as a mathematician, Professor Gibbons studies commutative and homological algebra, and her primary research interest is the study of infinite free resolutions (often through the lens of Boij-Soderberg theory). Gibbons also has a secondary interest in algebraic statistics. Since coming to Hamilton College, Professor Gibbons has supervised several commutative algebra undergraduate research projects at Hamilton, the Willamette Valley Mathematics Consortium REU, and the COURAGE (virtual) REU. She is currently an elected member of the Executive Committee of the Association for Women in Mathematics.\nDaughter of a jazz musician and public school teacher, Professor Gibbons grew up near New Haven, CT; she attended public schools in West Haven, Woodbridge, and Bethany, CT and earned her diploma from Amity High School in 2000. In 2006, she graduated Summa Cum Laude with her B.A. in mathematics with distinction from the Colorado College in Colorado Springs, CO. Subsequently, she worked for CC\u0026rsquo;s Math and Computer Science Department for a year after graduation as a paraprofessional. In 2009 and 2013 respectively, she earned her M.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nIn addition to being a multiply-certified math nerd and a reformed college dropout, Professor Gibbons likes to rock climb, argue about notation, and snuggle with cats.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://crgibbons.github.io/author/courtney-r.-gibbons/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/courtney-r.-gibbons/","section":"authors","summary":"Professor Gibbons wants to change the world.

Much of the Disciplinary Practice, Creativity, and Communication and Expression within mathematics comes through the process of solving a problem/proving a proposition and then writing it up. In this class, you will refine your proof writing skills and develop new mathematical prose writing skills.\nTypes of Assessments  Ready for Class (RC): Beginning of Class. We we are working toward answering one (huge!) mathematical problem; you will find it really helpful to review your notes and preview the book for these short quiz-like multiple choice assignments. I don’t reschedule these, but I do drop (at least) three low scores for everyone. For these assessments, you will need a Plickers card (distributed in class). If you lose yours, can you find a printable card here: Plickers Cards Homework (HW): Due Tuesdays at 4pm (rigid). The homework is graded by a Hamilton student and will be returned in 2-3 class periods. Because the written homework is graded by a student who is super-busy just like you, homework is due when it\u0026rsquo;s due! (Don\u0026rsquo;t @ me!) However, to help you out, I drop your lowest 2 homework scores. Midterm Exams (ME): Two 2-hour self-scheduled midterms. Before the first exam, I will post a preview that describes the kinds of questions, the point distributions, and other information that will help you study. Final Exam (FE): One 3-hour cumulative self-scheduled exam. The material on the final, though cumulative, will be weighted toward the material covered at the end of the course that was not tested on midterms. Writing Assignments (WA): Due Thursdays at 4pm (flexible). You will write up solutions to problems and responses to writing prompts roughly once a week using $\\LaTeX$ (via Overleaf with your Hamilton credentials) (sometimes solo, sometimes in partners). Each writing assignment is graded among the options E (exemplary), M (masterful), R (revisions necessary to meet expectations), and X (not enough to assess). You will have revision opportunities by invitation throughout the semester. Final Paper (FP): Due by beginning of our scheduled final exam period. This will be graded like a writing assignment; a lot of the content of this paper will come from writing assignments you\u0026rsquo;ve already completed, so think of it as a way to study for the final and get a chance to revise your writing one last time.  Grades Your base grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is calcullated by a combination of weighted average on some of your assignments (HW (25%); ME and FE (75%)) and minimum specifications on others (average RC score, scores out of $n$ total writing assignments, and score on the final paper). The following table lists minimum thresholds for each base grade. You must meet all the requirements in the row to earn that base grade. Ranges for $\\pm$ will be determined at the end of the semester at the professor’s discretion (typically $-$ will be assigned if you are close to a base grade but didn’t quite meet one of the criteria, and $+$ will be assigned for work consistently at the top of the base grade range).\n   Base Grade Ready for Class Weighted Avg of HW and Exams Writing Assignment scores Final Paper score     A 3 [90,100) $n-2$ scores of E E   B 3 [80,90) $n-3$ scores of E M   C 2 [70,80) $n-2$ scores of M or better M   D 1 [55,70) $n-4$ scores of M or better R   F 0 [0,55) $n$ scores of X or better X    The big picture is that, to do well in the course, you will need to demonstrate that you can do the computations well and write well at the 300-level. Throughout the semester you will have opportunities to revise your writing (and potentially receive a new score on an assignment) by responding to professor feedback.\nClassroom Environment The American Mathematical Society (the largest professional society for mathematicians) outlines its vision for a welcoming environment as follows:\n The AMS strives to ensure that participants in its activities enjoy a welcoming environment.

Number theory begins with the integers and the relationships (and remainders) that come from trying to divide one integer into another or find integer solutions to polynomial equations (like $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 42$). Although some original numberphiles celebrated number theory\u0026rsquo;s purity (read: its lack of applications to the \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo;), they\u0026rsquo;d be annoyed to know that we now use their results to accomplish many practical ends, like sending information via secure webpages, listening to scratched CDs, and speed-testing computers. This course will focus on the fundamental results in the field and their applications (especially to cryptography and cryptanalysis). Expect distinguished visitors from different schools and sectors to give short guest presentations in class. (See Endnotes 1)\nTexts   Number Theory Through Inquiry, by David C. Marshall, Edward Odell, and Michael Starbird (available from the Hamilton College Bookstore; see me if you have difficulty acquiring the book) The Princeton Companion to Mathematics, edited by Bowers-Green, Leader, and Gowers (access the ebook via the Hamilton College library with your Hamilton SSO)  Schedule of Topics Students will be (collectively) responsible for preparing, presenting, and recording solutions to almost every problem in Chapters 1-6. This makes it difficult to predict exactly when each topic will be covered, but we\u0026rsquo;ll start by assuming the following breakdown (roughly) and adapting as necessary:\n First third of the semester: Chapters 1-3; Middle third of the semester: Chapters 4-6; Remaining third of the semester: Choose Your Own Adventure (see below) In defiance of linear time: We will also cover some basic principles of cryptography and cryptanalysis \u0026ldquo;between\u0026rdquo; the first and second thirds of the semester.  Skills and Practices Speaking Intensive: This class will help you develop your ability to communicate mathematics orally in both formal and informal settings, and you will have several assessments to help you keep track of your progress: two oral midterms of very different natures along with assessments of your class presentations. To support your progress as an oral communicator of mathematics, I can help you during open hours and the QSR Center and the Oral Communication Center both have peer tutors who are familiar with mathematical presentations. You can also review this [helpful video by math major Chiara Bondi \u0026lsquo;22](link to video).\nEducational Goals: This course supports several of Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s Educational Goals. Much of the Disciplinary Practice, Creativity, and Communication and Expression within mathematics comes through the process of solving a problem or proving a proposition and communicating it to others. In this class, you will put your proof writing skills to work and develop new mathematical speaking skills.\nActive Learning: At first, you might feel a little uncomfort- able if you are used to lecture-based classes, but there\u0026rsquo;s good news! A Harvard study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recently demonstrated that stu- dents learn more in active learning classes: \u0026ldquo;[T]hough students felt as if they learned more through traditional lectures, they actually learned more when taking part in classrooms that employed so-called active-learning strategies.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\nTypes of Assessments  Active Attendance and Participation: Every Class. (10%) Get ready to work like a mathematician in this class. No more lectures! This class is active learning all-the-way, which means your attendance is critical for its success. You and your classmates will work together and uncover the major results through activities, groupwork, and good, old-fashioned hard work. Class Participation (CP): Frequently. (10%) Everyone will present often. Your CP grade will include your presentations and also your active participation in the discussion following (and sometimes during) others\u0026rsquo; presentations. Want help? Visit the Oral Communication Center to practice presenting. Oral Midterm Exam (OME): 30 minutes. (15%) We will use a random number generator (like a 10-sided die) to select from a list of pre-selected midterm problems, and you will present the selected problem to me in my office at the blackboard. I will follow up with some questions. Oral Midterm Conversation (OMC): 30 minutes. (15%) You will explain an application of Number Theory to a non-specialist during this exam. Details will be posted on Blackboard. Midterm Skills Exam (MSE): 1 hour. (15%) This short problem set will test your computational skills. Provided the Honor Code is working for our class, you will be able to self-schedule this exam. Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA): (20%) Team-based self-guided inquiry on a number theoretic topic of your choosing. A menu of options is available, but you can also pitch your own topic. As part of this assignment, you will write a short chapter on the topic in the collaborative course notes (including homework problems and solutions). Final Skills Exam (FE): (15%) One 3-hour cumulative self-scheduled exam delivered through Blackboard in one-hour chunks (you can take breaks in between chunks).  Grades    A+ A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D D-     98% 94% 90% 87% 84% 80% 77% 73% 70% 66% 62% 60%    Classroom Environment The American Mathematical Society (the largest professional society for mathematicians) outlines its vision for a welcoming environment as follows:\n The AMS strives to ensure that participants in its activities enjoy a welcoming environment. In all its activities, the AMS seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas. The AMS supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or immigration status\u0026hellip;. A commitment to a welcoming environment is expected of all attendees at AMS activities, including mathematicians, students, guests, staff, contractors and exhibitors, and participants in scientific sessions and social events.\n I am committed to the same vision for our classroom environment, and I sincerely thank you for your contributions toward making our classroom (and office hours) a lively and respectful community of thinkers. Please let me know if you feel that we have strayed from this vision at any point during the semester. (See Endnotes 2)\nYour Responsibilities Accommodations, Conflicts, \u0026amp; Makeup Exams Please give me notice at least one week prior to an that you have an academic accommodation or a conflict. Since the exams in this course are self-scheduled, I hope this allows you the flexibility to plan around your other obligations, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to work with you if you need additional flexibility.\nAttendance \u0026amp; Honor By enrolling in this class, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to come to class with a learner\u0026rsquo;s attitude, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same. If you need to miss a class, please fill out the Class Absence Request Form (link available on Blackboard). You are part of a community that believes in the power of the Honor Code to make Hamilton College a great place to be a student and a teacher. We are all bound by the responsibility to actively create and maintain a culture of learning, academic integrity, and personal honor. I do not take my responsibility lightly; nor should you! (See Endnotes 3)\nGetting Stuck Being stumped is part of learning mathematics, so please attempt to solve problems on your own before asking for help on them. Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged as long as you are collaborating with your peers currently enrolled in any section of Math 512. However, make sure to write up your final drafts separately to ensure that you have each fully understood the answer(s). Similarly, even though you may submit joint assignments, it is your responsibility to make sure you understand and approve of all the mathematics your team turns in. (See Endnotes 4)\nIMPORTANT! Please check with me before using resources other than your classmates, tutors at the Academic Resource Centers, or online $\\LaTeX$ help. For example, check with me before asking other professors, students not currently enrolled in Math 325, the internet, a magic eight ball, the ghost of Gauss, etc! Mathematical plagiarism is a subtle business, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to accidentally plagiarize by copying a solution you\u0026rsquo;ve read somewhere else. If you use external resources on an assignment that allows them, you must use an open source resource (no Chegg, Math Stack Exchange, or ChatGPT!), you must disclose that you used it, and in the case of generative AI you must share your prompt or sequence of prompts.

If you wantonly skip class, aside from missing out on the learning community within the walls of our classroom, you\u0026rsquo;ll penalize yourself by getting lower homework and test scores than you otherwise would. And anyway, I do notice if you\u0026rsquo;re not in class. Honor Code issues aside, you\u0026rsquo;re doing your education a disservice if you turn in work you have not personally thought through carefully. Plus, some problems will reappear on exams. Seriously, though: you can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;unsee\u0026rdquo; someone else\u0026rsquo;s solution.

This year, the course will examine several big themes:\n Belonging – what is “mathematical identity” and where does it come from? Civil Rights – can mathematical literacy be viewed as a tool for advancing equity? Political Districting – how does mathematics help us understand gerrymandering? Algorithms – in what ways do algorithms contribute to or fight against social stratification?  Educational Goals In addition to satisfying the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies (SSIH) requirement for the concentration in Mathematics and Statistics, this course addresses the following Educational Goals.\n Intellectual Curiosity and Flexibility – examining fact, phenomena, and issues in-depth, and from a variety of perspectives, and having the courage to revise beliefs and outlooks in light of new evidence Understanding of Cultural Diversity – critically engaging with multiple cultural traditions and perspectives Ethical, Informed, and Engaged Citizenship – developing an awareness of the challenges and responsibilities of local, national, and global citizenship Communication and Expression – expressing oneself with clarity and eloquence, in both traditional and contemporary media, through writing and speaking  Expectations and Assignments To dig deeply into the main themes of the course, you will need to prepare in advance for each class, actively participate, and complete all of the assignments. This is reflected in the final grade composition:\n Blog Posts: 40% Participation: 30% Final Poster: 30%  Pre-Class Tasks (Reading, Watching, or Listening) Complete the relevant task (reading, watching, or listening) assigned for each class, think about it carefully, and outline some thoughts to share in our class discussion. The list of tasks can be found on the last page of this document and may be updated (in a timely manner!) as the semester progresses.\nAttendance Your attendance and active participation is really important to the stability and success of our learning community! If you need to miss more classes, please fill out the Absence Request Form in advance (link available on Blackboard). Every student may miss one class; if you need to miss more than that, we need to talk. Undiscussed absences (besides the first freebie) will lower your participation grade.\nBlog Posts Our course blog is a (class-only) space for you to engage critically with the course materials. Writing the blog posts will help you and your classmates initiate and inform class discussions. They will also give you the opportunity to practice skills directly related to effective writing, such as conciseness, clarity, and vividness. You will contribute an original blog post five (5) times throughout the semester according to the schedule posted on Blackboard.\nEach blog post should:\n identify a specific concept/idea/argument from the assigned task (with reference); either demonstrate understanding of the concept at issue and express agreement or disagreement, giving reasons, OR connect it to previous ideas/discussions, or to contemporary issues, OR introduce an example/counter-example not explored in the text; be more than be simply a summary or an unsupported opinion (“I liked this reading”); end with a potential question or topic for class discussion, related to your post.  Each blog post should be between 150 and 250 words. You must post your contribution by 7pm the day before our class meeting. I will grade each post according to the rubric posted on Blackboard.\nFinal Poster As a capstone assignment, you will create a poster to explore a topic of your choice. This poster will be due after spring break, and we will convene for one more class session to present the class posters to the Math and Stats department. You must submit a brief outline (bullet points are fine) of the content of your poster by the last day of the course. A pdf of your final poster is the third Tuesday after spring break, and you should submit your request to print the poster to LITS on this date as well. The poster should be well organized with clear exposition and proper citations. Please see https://libguides.hamilton.edu/c.php?g=749942\u0026amp;p=5370642 for more information about the technical aspects of creating a poster.\nRequired Books Robert P.

We we are working toward answering one (huge!) mathematical problem; you will find it really helpful to review your notes and preview the book for these short quiz-like multiple choice assignments. I don’t reschedule these, but I do drop (at least) three low scores for everyone. (We can work out COVID contingencies as necessary!) Homework (HW): Due Tuesdays at 4pm (rigid). The homework is graded by a Hamilton student and will be returned in 2-3 class periods. Because the written homework is graded by a student who is super-busy just like you, homework is due when it\u0026rsquo;s due! (Don\u0026rsquo;t @ me!) However, to help you out, I drop your lowest 2 homework scores. Midterm Exams (ME): Two 2-hour self-scheduled midterms. Before the first exam, I will post a preview that describes the kinds of questions, the point distributions, and other information that will help you study. Final Exam (FE): One 3-hour cumulative self-scheduled exam. The material on the final, though cumulative, will be weighted toward the material covered at the end of the course that was not tested on midterms. Writing Assignments (WA): Due Thursdays at 4pm (flexible). You will write up solutions to problems and responses to writing prompts roughly once a week using $\\LaTeX$ (via Overleaf with your Hamilton SSO) (sometimes solo, sometimes in partners). Each writing assignment is graded among the options E (exemplary), M (masterful), R (consider revising), and X (not enough to assess). Final Paper (FP): Due by beginning of our scheduled final exam period. This will be graded like a writing assignment; a lot of the content of this paper will come from writing assignments you\u0026rsquo;ve already completed, so think of it as a way to study for the final and get a chance to revise your writing one last time.  Classroom Environment The American Mathematical Society (the largest professional society for mathematicians) outlines its vision for a welcoming environment as follows:\n The AMS strives to ensure that participants in its activities enjoy a welcoming environment. In all its activities, the AMS seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas. The AMS supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or immigration status\u0026hellip;. A commitment to a welcoming environment is expected of all attendees at AMS activities, including mathematicians, students, guests, staff, contractors and exhibitors, and participants in scientific sessions and social events.\n I am committed to the same vision for our classroom environment, and I sincerely thank you for your contributions toward making our classroom (and office hours) a lively and respectful community of thinkers. Please let me know if you feel that we have strayed from this vision at any point during the semester. (See Endnotes 2)\nYour Responsibilities Accommodations, Conflicts, \u0026amp; Makeup Exams Please give me notice at least one week prior to an that you have an academic accommodation or a conflict. Since the exams in this course are self-scheduled, I hope this allows you the flexibility to plan around your other obligations, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to work with you if you need additional flexibility.\nAttendance \u0026amp; Honor By enrolling in this class, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to come to class with a learner\u0026rsquo;s attitude, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same. If you need to miss a class, please fill out the Class Absence Request Form (link available on Blackboard). You are part of a community that believes in the power of the Honor Code to make Hamilton College a great place to be a student and a teacher. We are all bound by the responsibility to actively create and maintain a culture of learning, academic integrity, and personal honor. I do not take my responsibility lightly; nor should you! (See Endnotes 3)\nGetting Stuck Being stumped is part of learning mathematics, so please attempt to solve homework problems on your own before asking for help on them. Collaboration on the homework is encouraged as long as you are collaborating with your peers currently enrolled in any section of Math 325. However, make sure to write up your final drafts separately to ensure that you have each fully understood the answer(s). Similarly, even though you will be assigned a writing partner for the writing assignments, it is your responsibility to make sure you understand and approve of all the mathematics your team turns in. (See Endnotes 4)\nIMPORTANT! Please check with me before using resources other than your classmates, tutors at the QSR or Writing Centers, or online $\\LaTeX$ help. For example, check with me before asking other professors, students not currently enrolled in Math 325, the internet, a magic eight ball, the ghost of Gauss, etc! Mathematical plagiarism is a subtle business, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to accidentally plagiarize by copying a solution you\u0026rsquo;ve read somewhere else.

If you wantonly skip class, aside from missing out on the learning community within the walls of our classroom, you\u0026rsquo;ll penalize yourself by getting lower homework and test scores than you otherwise would. And anyway, I do notice if you\u0026rsquo;re not in class. Honor Code issues aside, you\u0026rsquo;re doing your education a disservice if you turn in work you have not personally thought through carefully. Plus, some Writing Assignment problems will reappear on exams or on the final paper. Seriously, though: you can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;unsee\u0026rdquo; someone else\u0026rsquo;s solution. There are deep and interesting ethical conundra lurking here; Googling unwisely (or at all) may lead you down a path you didn\u0026rsquo;t intend to low.

We show that the ML degree is equal to the degree of the toric variety for generic scalings, while it drops if and only if the scaling vector is in the locus of the principal $A$-determinant. We also illustrate how to compute the ML estimate of a toric variety numerically via homotopy continuation from a scaled toric variety with low ML degree. Throughout, we include examples motivated by algebraic geometry and statistics. We compute the ML degree of rational normal scrolls and a large class of Veronese-type varieties. In addition, we investigate the ML degree of scaled Segre varieties, hierarchical loglinear models, and graphical models.","tags":[],"title":"The Maximum Likelihood Degree of Toric Varieties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Courtney Gibbons","Josh Laison","Eric J.

That is, given a Betti diagram, we decompose it into pure diagrams. Relaxing the requirement that the degree sequences in such pure diagrams be totally ordered, we are able to define a multiplication law for Betti diagrams that respects the decomposition and allows us to write a simple expression of the decomposition of the Betti diagram of any complete intersection in terms of the degrees of its minimal generators. In the more traditional sense, the decomposition of complete intersections of codimension at most 3 are also computed as given by the totally ordered decomposition algorithm obtained from (ES1). In higher codimension, obstructions arise that inspire our work on an alternative algorithm.","tags":["Boij-Soederberg"],"title":"Non-simplicial decompositions of Betti diagrams of complete intersections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Courtney Gibbons","Josh Laison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349064000,"objectID":"e67c08dd91817054ad2f85b6894de205","permalink":"https://crgibbons.github.io/publication/glaison1/glaison1/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glaison1/glaison1/","section":"publication","summary":"The fixing number of a graph $G$ is the smallest cardinality of a set of vertices $S$ such that only the trivial automorphism of $G$ fixes every vertex in $S$.

Several authors have studied the distinguishing number of a graph, the smallest number of labels needed to label $G$ so that the automorphism group of the labeled graph is trivial. The fixing number can be thought of as a variation of the distinguishing number in which every label may be used only once, and not every vertex need be labeled.
