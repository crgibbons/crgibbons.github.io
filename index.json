She studies commutative and homological algebra, and her primary research interest is the study of infinite free resolutions (often through the lens of Boij-Soderberg theory). Gibbons also has a secondary interest in algebraic statistics (particularly maximum likelihood degree of toric varieties arising from statistical models). Since coming to Hamilton College, Professor Gibbons has supervised a handful of commutative algebra undergraduate research projects at Hamilton and the Willamette Valley Mathematics Consortium REU.\nDaughter of a jazz musician and public school teacher, Professor Gibbons grew up near New Haven, CT; she attended public schools in West Haven, Woodbridge, and Bethany, CT and earned her diploma from Amity High School in 2000. In 2006, she graduated Summa Cum Laude with her B.A. in mathematics with disctinction from the Colorado College in Colorado Springs, CO. Subsequently, she worked for CC\u0026rsquo;s Math and Computer Science Department for a year after graduation as a paraprofessional. In 2009 and 2013 respectively, she earned her M.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nIn addition to being a multiply-certified math nerd and a reformed college dropout, Professor Gibbons likes to rock climb, argue about notation, and snuggle with cats.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/courtney-r.-gibbons/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/courtney-r.-gibbons/","section":"authors","summary":"Professor Courtney Gibbons joined the faculty at Hamilton College in July, 2013 and is currently an associate professor of mathematics.

By introducing scaling coefficients to the monomial parameterization of the toric variety, one can change the ML degree. We show that the ML degree is equal to the degree of the toric variety for generic scalings, while it drops if and only if the scaling vector is in the locus of the principal $A$-determinant. We also illustrate how to compute the ML estimate of a toric variety numerically via homotopy continuation from a scaled toric variety with low ML degree. Throughout, we include examples motivated by algebraic geometry and statistics. We compute the ML degree of rational normal scrolls and a large class of Veronese-type varieties.

That is, given a Betti diagram, we decompose it into pure diagrams. Relaxing the requirement that the degree sequences in such pure diagrams be totally ordered, we are able to define a multiplication law for Betti diagrams that respects the decomposition and allows us to write a simple expression of the decomposition of the Betti diagram of any complete intersection in terms of the degrees of its minimal generators. In the more traditional sense, the decomposition of complete intersections of codimension at most 3 are also computed as given by the totally ordered decomposition algorithm obtained from (ES1). In higher codimension, obstructions arise that inspire our work on an alternative algorithm.","tags":["Boij-Soederberg"],"title":"Non-simplicial decompositions of Betti diagrams of complete intersections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Courtney Gibbons","Josh Laison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349064000,"objectID":"1f4abebafabf4ce0d4ed7d9e26f1c86e","permalink":"/publication/glaison1/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glaison1/","section":"publication","summary":"The fixing number of a graph $G$ is the smallest cardinality of a set of vertices $S$ such that only the trivial automorphism of $G$ fixes every vertex in $S$. The fixing set of a group $\\Gamma$ is the set of  all fixing numbers of finite graphs with automorphism group $\\Gamma$. Several authors have studied the distinguishing number of a graph, the smallest number of labels needed to label $G$ so that the automorphism group of the labeled graph is trivial. The fixing number can be thought of as a variation of the distinguishing number in which every label may be used only once, and not every vertex need be labeled.
